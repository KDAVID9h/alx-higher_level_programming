# Python and C Tasks Project

This project consists of Python and C tasks that involve various programming concepts such as list manipulation, set operations, dictionary handling, and more.

## Tasks

1. **Squared simple:**
   - Description: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
   - Function: `square_matrix_simple(matrix=[])`

2. **Search and replace:**
   - Description: Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
   - Function: `search_replace(my_list, search, replace)`

3. **Unique addition:**
   - Description: Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
   - Function: `uniq_add(my_list=[])`

   ...

12. **Roman to Integer:**
   - Description: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
   - Function: `roman_to_int(roman_string)`

## Usage

Run the Python scripts or functions as needed for specific tasks. For C tasks, compile and execute the C programs.

For example:

```bash
./script.py arg1 arg2
gcc -o program file.c
./program
```

## Files

- `script.py`: Contains the solution for Python tasks.
- `helper_functions.py`: Contains additional Python functions.
- `program.c`: Contains the solution for C tasks.
- `lists.h`: Header file for C tasks.
